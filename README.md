# Functional analysis of omics data course

Lectures and material for the *Functional analysis of omics data* course (2020).

## Instructors

Lara Nonell, Magdalena Arnal, Joan Gibert and JÃºlia Perera-Bel from the MARGenomics Bioinformatics Unit.


# Learning objectives

To be able to provide tools to researchers, who generate omics data or want to analyze public data, for functional interpretation beyond a list of genes. During the course several public databases will be reviewed and different open source tools will be used. The last session will allow the analysis of own data with the tools learned.

After the course you should be able to...

* select the appropriate enrichment test for your data
* be aware of the different gene sets databases and public omics data repositories
* perform an enrichment test with a list of genes using DAVID
* perform GSEA
* do basic network manipulation with Cytoscape and
* use some apps to extend the functionality
* understand that reproducibility is a huge issue


# Program


* **Session one**
	* Fundamentals of omic data and functional analysis
	* Exploration of public databases (GEO, TCGA, cBioPortal, GTEx...)
	* GEA data analysis with GEO2R
	* Functional anotation and enrichment analysis with DAVID
	
* **Session two**
	* Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)
	* Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

* **Session three**
	* Cytoscape
	* Integration and expression data visualization with Cytoscape
	
* **Session four**
	* Hand on session to solve doubts and analyze own or public data. 
	* Review and apply the tools learned in the course.
